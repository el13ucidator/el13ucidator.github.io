            <h4>About el13ucidator</h4>
            <p>The name of this site refers not to the author. Rather, the name and purpose is derived from the Elucidator sword, a tool. Here, I intend to use writing to consolidate information, as well as to explore and share ideas. 
            Like the series that engendered the Elucidator, a focus of this site will be the application of scientific knowledge and, sometimes, engineering's partnership with medicine.</p>

            <h4>About the author</h4>            
			<p>I am currently an MD-PhD student researching the molecular basis of gene expression -- more specifically, how RNA is made from a DNA template and what happens when that process is deregulated. 
					My work largely involves pipetting at the bench and sometimes coding to explore genomic or RNA sequencing data. </p>
